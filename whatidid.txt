Optimize images (used irfanview and photoshop)

made js async where possible

inlined styles (there was no real below the fold, so I inlined everything)

Changed the styles to prioritize smaller (mobile) devices -- no change to score, but 
making a practice of mobile-first development.

optimized delivery of web fonts by loading using js

==TODO==

minify html /js/ etc.

compress everything




Pizzas:

reduced the number of animated pizzas to 12, because we don't actually see any more than 
the first few pizzas. == Actually 48, because I started using a bigger monitor.

changed the style of the .mover class to will-change: transform; (to create layer)

moved the dx and newwidth variable definitions (for resizing pizzas) outside of the loop
that iterates through the pizza resize.

created a new variable pizzaElements to contain the pizza container ids (so we don't have to keep looking)

change the querySelectorAll to getDocumentByClassName

significantly simplified the code used to resize pizzas

TODO:

change the pizza container to will-change: transform; ?
